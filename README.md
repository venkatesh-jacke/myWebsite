### The root folders have been uploaded in my repository t contains all .php .html .css files also included the database file .sql
## Make sure you host it in your local server or in your web service like aws....
## If your hosting in a local server like WAMP make sure the folders are under the "WWW" folder so that it can access it..

## If your hosting in a local server like XAMP make sure the folders are under the "HTDOCS" folder so that it can access it..

## NOTE : SQL takes port 3306  Apache takes port 80 for http
## Make sure that you have separate port listening to each so that it runs the services smoothly
